1£¬What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
during the method coding part, that was fine, but the testing part, there were some issure occured, when I Initialize a triangle class which will raise an exception, over there, I can not catch the exception, by using assertRaise, I cannot pass the test, but later I googled, and found another solution by using try except, not just using one simple assertRaises(). And that finally works.

2, What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
not adequate enough, because what if the value given are not correct for the class to form a actual triangle, the whole requirement is based on there is an existing triangle, but what if it is not at all, those things should be taken into consideration as well.

3, What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
assertRaise() function in unittest

4, Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
due to any situation, that can occur in a reality world.
if the value of the sides have been assigned accuately?
are the values of those sides able to form a real triangle?
whether the triangle a scalene right triangles or a scalene triangles?
whether the triangle a isosceles right triangles or a isosceles triangles?
whether the triangle a equilateral triangles?
So take all account into consideration, after passing all the tests, I thought my work had done
